# Python Challenge - Module 3
by **Anqa Javed**
## Overview

This repository contains the code for **Module 3** of my Python Challenge. The task involves two parts:

1. **PyBank**: Financial analysis to process a dataset of financial records.
2. **PyPoll**: Election analysis to process a dataset of election results.

### **PyBank Analysis**:
- This script processes a dataset (`budget_data.csv`) containing financial records of a company.
- The analysis calculates:
  - Total number of months in the dataset.
  - Net total amount of "Profit/Losses".
  - Average change in "Profit/Losses".
  - Greatest increase and decrease in profits.
- Results are displayed in the terminal and saved to a text file (`budget_analysis.txt`).

### **PyPoll Analysis**:
- This script processes an election dataset (`election_data.csv`) containing voter data.
- The analysis calculates:
  - Total number of votes cast.
  - Total number of votes for each candidate and their percentage of votes.
  - The winner of the election.
- Results are displayed in the terminal and saved to a text file (`election_analysis.txt`).

## Files Included
